<h1>Open a Data File from an Internet Address</h1>
Use this dialog box to open a data file in SPSS, Excel, SAS, or Stata format from the web.
The file will be downloaded to your computer and then opened.  The dialog can also be used
to download and save files of any other type, but these will not be opened.

<p><span class="runinhead">Web Location and Data File Name.</span> 
Enter the full Internet address of a file to open, including the protocol such as http:// or ftp://.
The file will be downloaded to a temporary directory on your computer and opened.  Save it in
a permanent location if you plan to use it again.
<p><span class="runinhead">File Type.</span>
Choose SPSS, Excel, SAS, or Stata as the file type.  The versions of these files that are supported
correspond to the versions you can open from the standard File Open dialog box.  Choose
Other to only download and save a file.
<p><span class="runinhead">Save Folder.</span> If you select Other as the file type,
specify an existing folder where the file should be stored.  The file name will
be taken from the download uri.</p>
<p class="bullet">• An existing file may or may not be overwritten
depending on the operating system and file permissions.  If a file name
collision occurs, the file may be left in the target folder under a temporary name.</p>
<p><span class="runinhead">Dataset Name to Assign.</span>
Optionally assign an SPSS dataset name to the file being opened.  This is not a file name but a name
used to manage data files when more than one may be open.
<p><span class="runinhead">Options for Excel Files.</span>
These options apply only to Excel files and are ignored if another file type is used.  They correspond to the
options available from the standard File Open dialog.
<p><span class="runinhead">Sheet Number to Read.</span>
If the file has more than one sheet, specify which one to read by number or name.  By default, sheet
number 1 is read.  Do not specify both a name and a number.
<p><span class="runinhead">Sheet Name to Read.</span>
You can specify the sheet to read by entering the name here.  If both a name and number are given.
the name takes priority.
<p><span class="runinhead">Cell Range.</span> By default, all cells are read.  You can specify
a cell range to limit the area read.
<p><span class="runinhead">Read variable names from first row.</span>
Check this box to take the variable names for the SPSS dataset from the first row of the range.
Names that are invalid as SPSS names will be automatically replaced.
<p><span class="runinhead">Assumed maximum string width.</span>
By default strings are assigned a width of 32767.  You can specify a smaller number here.

<p><span class="runinhead">Options for SAS Files.</span>
You can enter the name of a specific SAS dataset within the file to read.
